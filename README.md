Training Sessions for C Language

This repository is to keep track of some of the exercises I did to prepare for C course at university of Parma.

The Files tagged with a date are relative to exam simulations, so should be the most interesting cases.
Also the "Scacchi" / "Scacchiera" files are interesteing as it was the first real troublesome code I bumped into.
